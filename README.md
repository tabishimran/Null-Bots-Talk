# Setting up the exercises


## Dependencies 

### Linux 
- Install apache and php packages required to host php based content. ( Google this if you're not sure how to do this )

### Windows
- Install xampp

## Setting up the dummy websites
- Extract contents of apache.tar.gz and set them in the base directory for apache.
- This is typically the '/var/www/html' directory on linux based systems.
- Make sure the files are in the base directory and not in sub directories or else 'robots.txt' based
  exercises will fail. You should be able to access the exercises on 'localhost/exercise1' etc. 


# If you find bugs
The code isn't exactly amazing, I'm not really a web-dev, do report the issues, i'll try to fix them.
I might want to improve on the exercises eventually and make this into a better exercise.

# Contributing

If you are a web developer, feel free to improve the exercises in any way you wish to. 
I would appreciate any help I could get.
